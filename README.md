## Hi, this is Lee ðŸ¦©

I started off in the data space in 2016 doing analyses with Python, then quickly fell in love with software engineering. I love to build things that spark joy, and in my spare time learn new programming languages. In 2020 I attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) and built an [opinionated chord generator](https://scherz.netlify.app/) w/ Clojure. You can find out more about me (and my cat) [here](https://leearaneta.github.io/)!
